SAMPLE MCQ  ON EVM OPCODE

PREPARED BY DR.G.SOUNDRA PANDIAN


In an EVM the the total size of the stack is

a) 1024 bytes
b) 1024 words where 1 word is 256 bits
c) 2^256 bytes
d) 2^256 words where 1 word is 256 bits

Answer: b)
2. In an EVM the the total size of the MEMORY is

a) 1024 bytes
b) 1024 words where 1 word is 256 bits
c) 2^256 bytes
d) 2^256 words where 1 word is 256 bits
Answer: c)

3. In an EVM the the total size of the STORAGE is

a) 1024 bytes
b) 1024 words where 1 word is 256 bits
c) 2^256 bytes
d) 2^256 words where 1 word is 256 bits

Answer: d)


4. The difference between Memory and Storage is that

a)Memory is persistant and Storage is volatile
b) The amount of gas required to save data into storage is one of the lowest among operations of the EVM.
c) Storage is persistant and Memory is not persistant
d) The capacity of memory and that of storage are equal and both are read/write type

Ans: c)

5. Find the opcode that is not valid

a) MSTORE8
b) SSTORE8
c) SWAP32
d) CALLDATACOPY

Ans: b)

6. Examin the following code

PUSH1 0x04
PUSH1 0x03
ADD  
PUSH1 0x02
MUL  
PUSH1 0x00
SSTORE  

a) This will add the two numbers 0x03 and 0x02 to bring a result of 0x05
b) This will multiply 0x02 and 0x00 to bring a result of 0x00
c) This will produce a result of 0x0E
d) The storage will be made all zeros.

Ans: c   (4+3 =7  and 7*2 = 14 = 0x0E that is stored in slot 0 of storage)


7.  In the program given below

04: 5B     JUMPDEST
05: 34     CALLVALUE
06: 80     DUP1
07: 15     ISZERO
08: 61     PUSH2 0x0010
0B: 57     JUMPI
0C: 6000   PUSH1 0x00
0E: 80     DUP1
0F: FD     REVERT
10: 56     JUMP
11: 50     POP
12: 60C7   PUSH1 0xc7
14: 80     DUP1
15: 61001F PUSH2 0x001f

After executing the JUMPI instruction at location 0B, the program will jump to the location at

a) O4
b) 0F
c) 05
d) 10

Answer: d)
